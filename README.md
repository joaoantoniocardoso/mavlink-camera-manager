- Configure video4linux camera controls, like brightness, saturation, etc.
- SDP files available, allowing easy access from video players like [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/)
- Redirect 3rd party streams, advertising them via MAVLink protocol

## How to use it

### 1. Downloading

Download the mavlink-camera-manager binary for your architecture from our [releases](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink-camera-manager/releases), or build it from sources as [described here](#how-to-build-it)

### 2. Installing

- First, install the required runtime dependencies (assuming a ubuntu-based distro):

```Bash
sudo apt update -y && \
sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends \
   libgstreamer1.0-0 \
   libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-0 \
   libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-0 \
   libgstrtspserver-1.0-0
```

_note: GSTreamer needs to be at least version `1.16.0`. You can check it by running `gst-launch-1.0 --version`._

- Extract the zip
- optionally, put the folder to your Linux PATH

### 3. Running

After [the installion](#2-installing), the binary can be run by calling it from the terminal, as simple as:

```Bash
mavlink-camera-manager --mavlink=tcpout:0.0.0.0:14000 --verbose
```

At this point, the API should be ready. By default, it's accessible from any computer in the same network at port `6020`, but it is customizable using the `--rest-server` CLI argument.

For more information about the CLI arguments, `mavlink-camera-manager --help` will give a list of accepted parameters for your version.

- Along with the REST API, a simple management interface is available at http://localhost:6020, in which streams can be created and managed:
  ![picture 1](images/management_interface.png)

- For developers, the Swagger UI with documentation for the entire REST API can be found at http://localhost:6020/docs
  ![picture 2](images/swagger_ui.png)

## Quick test guide

The short clip below shows how an H264 UDP stream can be configured using the management interface, and how it can be accessed as a WebRTC stream.

<!-- TODO: #### Receiving a stream from a video player like VLC -->

#### Receiving a stream from a MAVLink ground control stations like QGroundControl

The video should automatically popup if you are using any modern GCS, like QGroundControl, that has support for MAVLink camera messages.

1. Start `mavlink-camera-manager`
2. Start `mavproxy` or `sim_vehicle` with a **TCP server** at `5777` (mavlink-camera-manager's default can be changed via the CLI argument `--mavlink`)
3. Open your Ground Control Station
4. Done

#### Receiving a stream from a GStreamer pipeline

1. Start `mavlink-camera-manager`
2. Run the following pipeline:

- If **RTSP** (any encoding):

```Bash
gstreamer-launch-1.0 rtspsrc location=$RTSP_ADDR latency=0 \
   ! decodebin
   ! fpsdisplaysink sync=false
```

- If **UDP** (H264 only):

```Bash
gstreamer-launch-1.0 udpsrc port=$PORT \
   ! application/x-rtp,payload=96 \
   ! rtph264depay \
   ! avdec_h264 discard-corrupted-frames=true \
   ! videoconvert
   ! fpsdisplaysink sync=false
```

## How to build it

1. Install the development dependencies:

```Bash
sudo apt update -y &&\
sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends \
   libunwind-dev \
   libclang-dev \
   libssl-dev \
   pkg-config \
   libmount-dev \
   libsepol-dev \
   libselinux1-dev \
   libglib2.0-dev \

git clone git@github.com:mavlink/mavlink-camera-manager.git &&\
cd mavlink-camera-manager
```

5. Build it with cargo:

```Bash

## Project origins

The Mavlink Camera Manager project originated as a personal experiment by [@patrickelectric](github.com/patrickelectric/), driven by the need to address a critical challenge in remotely operated vehicles â€“ effectively managing and providing camera streams to the topside computer. At the time, there was a noticeable absence of open-source alternatives, which motivated the project's inception.

Over time, the project gained recognition and was officially embraced by [**Blue Robotics**](https://github.com/bluerobotics) as a core development effort. It became an integral part of their operating system, BlueOS, and was widely distributed worldwide. The adoption of the Mavlink Camera Manager by Blue Robotics served as a testament to its capabilities and value.

Due to increasing interest from other developers and integrators, the project was transferred to the [**MAVLink organization**](https://github.com/mavlink) on May 25, 2023.
